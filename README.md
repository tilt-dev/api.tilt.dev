# api.tilt.dev

Reference docs for the Tilt API

https://api.tilt.dev/

## What

The future of Tilt is a simple model consisting of very few types of building
blocks, and a mix of uniformity and versatility whereby using the same simple
elements one can build complex systems and different types of functionality.

The [Tilt apiserver](https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-apiserver) is the base
layer of that model.

This repository generates the API that the current Tilt server supports.

## How

To run api.tilt.dev locally, run:

```
tilt up
```

Tilt will bring up the API in a container.

Commits to the main branch will automatically deploy to api.tilt.dev on Netlify.

## Generating the API

The Tilt API server generates openapi-spec/swagger.json, a complete specification
of Tilt's API objects.

The Kubernetes project automates this generation with this Bash script:

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/update-openapi-spec.sh

Currently we generate this by running:

```
tilt dump openapi > openapi-spec/swagger.json
```

Then we generate markdown for the api docs with:

```
make gendocs
```

This uses Kubernetes' doc generation code to generate pages for each API type.
