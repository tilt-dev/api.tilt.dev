Tilt is a toolkit for building multi-service dev environments.

Tilt offers many first-party data types like Docker builds and Kubernetes
appliers. But long-term, we want to make it easier for users to define their own
data types and behaviors.

The future of Tilt is a simple model consisting of very few types of
building blocks, and a mix of uniformity and versatility whereby using the same
simple elements one can build complex systems and different types of
functionality.

This page is the reference documentation for Tilt's public API.
