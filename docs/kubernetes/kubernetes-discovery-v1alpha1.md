## KubernetesDiscoverySpec {#KubernetesDiscoverySpec}


KubernetesDiscoverySpec defines the desired state of KubernetesDiscovery

<hr>

- **watches** ([]KubernetesWatchRef), required

  Watches determine what resources are discovered.
  
  If a discovered resource (e.g. Pod) matches the KubernetesWatchRef UID exactly, it will be reported. If a discovered resource is transitively owned by the KubernetesWatchRef UID, it will be reported.

  <a name="KubernetesWatchRef"></a>
  *KubernetesWatchRef is similar to v1.ObjectReference from the Kubernetes API and is used to determine what objects should be reported on based on discovery.*

  - **watches.namespace** (string), required

    Namespace is the Kubernetes namespace for discovery. Required.

  - **watches.name** (string)

    Name is the Kubernetes object name.
    
    This is not directly used in discovery; it is extra metadata.

  - **watches.uid** (string)

    UID is a Kubernetes object UID.
    
    It should either be the exact object UID or the transitive owner.

- **extraSelectors** ([]LabelSelector)

  ExtraSelectors are label selectors that will force discovery of a Pod even if it does not match the AncestorUID.
  
  This should only be necessary in the event that a CRD creates Pods but does not set an owner reference to itself.

  <a name="LabelSelector"></a>
  *A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects.*

  - **extraSelectors.matchExpressions** ([]LabelSelectorRequirement)

    matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

    <a name="LabelSelectorRequirement"></a>
    *A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.*

  - **extraSelectors.matchExpressions.key** (string), required

    *Patch strategy: merge on key `key`*
    
    key is the label key that the selector applies to.

  - **extraSelectors.matchExpressions.operator** (string), required

    operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

  - **extraSelectors.matchExpressions.values** ([]string)

    values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

  - **extraSelectors.matchLabels** (map[string]string)

    matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

- **podLogStreamTemplateSpec** (PodLogStreamTemplateSpec)

  PodLogStreamTemplateSpec describes the data model for PodLogStreams that KubernetesDiscovery should set up.
  
  The KubernetesDiscovery controller will attach PodLogStream objects to all active pods it discovers.
  
  If no template is specified, the controller will stream all pod logs available from the apiserver.

  <a name="PodLogStreamTemplateSpec"></a>
  *PodLogStreamTemplateSpec describes common attributes for PodLogStreams that can be shared across pods.*

  - **podLogStreamTemplateSpec.ignoreContainers** ([]string)

    The names of containers to exclude from the stream.
    
    If `onlyContainers` and `ignoreContainers` are not set, will watch all containers in the pod.

  - **podLogStreamTemplateSpec.onlyContainers** ([]string)

    The names of containers to include in the stream.
    
    If `onlyContainers` and `ignoreContainers` are not set, will watch all containers in the pod.

  - **podLogStreamTemplateSpec.sinceTime** (Time)

    An RFC3339 timestamp from which to show logs. If this value precedes the time a pod was started, only logs since the pod start will be returned. If this value is in the future, no logs will be returned.
    
    Translates directly to the underlying PodLogOptions.

    <a name="Time"></a>
    *Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.*

- **portForwardTemplateSpec** (PortForwardTemplateSpec)

  PortForwardTemplateSpec describes the data model for port forwards that KubernetesDiscovery should set up.
  
  The KubernetesDiscovery controller will choose a "best" candidate for attaching the port-forwarding. Only one PortForward will be active at a time.

  <a name="PortForwardTemplateSpec"></a>
  *PortForwardTemplateSpec describes common attributes for PortForwards that can be shared across pods.*

  - **portForwardTemplateSpec.forwards** ([]Forward), required

    One or more port forwards to execute on the given pod. Required.

    <a name="Forward"></a>
    *Forward defines a port forward to execute on a given pod.*

  - **portForwardTemplateSpec.forwards.containerPort** (int32), required

    The port on the Kubernetes pod to connect to. Required.

  - **portForwardTemplateSpec.forwards.host** (string)

    Optional host to bind to on the current machine (localhost by default)

  - **portForwardTemplateSpec.forwards.localPort** (int32)

    The port to expose on the current machine.
    
    If not specified (or 0), a random free port will be chosen and can be discovered via the status once established.

  - **portForwardTemplateSpec.forwards.name** (string)

    Name to identify this port forward.

  - **portForwardTemplateSpec.forwards.path** (string)

    Path to include as part of generated links for port forward.
